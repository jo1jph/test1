            <h2>Whether they are fleeing economic deprivation or are looking for a more evolved society - or both - people won’t stop trying to cross borders in search of a normal life.</h2>
                           <h2>Below you will read about some of the hard decisions and consequences on both sides - immigrants and government.</h2>
<br>
  <div class="flex_containe item2"><img src="images\pop.gif" alt="">  </div>
<br>
<br>

<p>Immigration is one of the most complex issues we face in the 21st century, especially here in the UK, relating to many key policy areas, from the NHS to the welfare reform.<p>
<p>The net migration target has been the centrepiece of UK government policy on immigration since 2010.
It's aimed at reducing numbers to the thousands and was set to be hit by 2015 but that never happened.</p>
<p>Striking the balance between the people who come to live in a country and people who leave for somewhere else has proven to be extremely hard. The numbers include all people moving to and from the UK, regardless of their citizenship or whether they come as international students, family members, refugees or for work. </p>
<p>There’s an important distinction to me made between refugees and migrants. This feature does not discuss refugees fleeing from armed conflict. </p>
<div class="flex_container1">
<img src="images\map.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
<p>The government has implemented different policies to try and decrease immigration like a £18, 600 minimum threshold for everyone who wants to bring a non-EU spouse.</p>
<p>Or a crackdown on the abuse of the student migration system, with some education establishments losing the right to sponsor non-EU students.
</p>
<p>
Despite these policies, net migration is still well above the target, but it has dropped largely since the Brexit referendum.
</p>
<p>It was a key factor in the decision to leave the European Union. Freedom of movement currently means, EU citizens can live and work anywhere within the the union. It has heightened the competition for jobs, pushing pay down.
It is not surprising there are strong anti-immigration feelings in areas that have seen surges in foreign born population. The influx has put immense pressure on health services, social services and housing.
</p>

<p>Some British firms employ many immigrant workers, with many business arguing the UK needs continued access to EU migrants to remain successful.
Others argue that businesses would adapt to lower EU migration, for example by increasing wages so they could attract British workers. Or relying more on technology rather than a low wage staff.
</p>
<p>Whether you voted ‘Leave’ or ‘Remain’, whether your opinions of immigrants are based on media coverage or actually knowing a person, whether those opinions are positive or negative, the countless statistics represent individuals.</p>
<p>Maybe you think immigrants are lazy, corrupt, criminal, are distorting the national identity and are draining the welfare system.
Or you think they are better skilled and educated with attitudes to make the UK more productive. </p>
<p>You might be right either way. We are talking about more than nine million people. Surely, some of them are here to take advantage of the benefits system but some are here to make the UK better.</p>
<p>There is one thing for sure in this divisive debate. The media has a huge impact on how we view people. It is how we build opinions about issues and there are hundreds of different views on the topic but let's not forget we talk about human beings. </p>
<br><h2>The numbers below show the rapid shift of what the UK looks like.</h2>

<p>I’ve never been on a plane before. It took me 18 years to get on one and maybe it won’t come as a surprise but I absolutely hated it. The loud noise coming from the engines, the tiny space, the absolute lack of privacy, the long line to even step on board and then the even longer one at the border. Every step I took towards that plane felt like another punch to my gut, a little squeeze of my heart with every stride away from my home.
</p>
<br>
                    <p>When I think about it now, I am not sure I realised what i was doing. I found myself at terminal one of Sofia Airport (Bulgaria) 11 days after my prom. I missed my own graduation just so i could catch a flight. A flight to a better life, or just to a normal one for that matter. I remember the 4th of June as if it was yesterday. Sadly, or maybe not, it was three years ago. Fresh after high school, stupidly in love and barely affording life as it was, this seemed like an attractive option but i didn’t really want to go for it. </p><br>
                        <p>I’m not sure whose decision it was at the end. My ex-boyfriend suggested it as a joke one day. “Do you want to try, we can always come back?” and then all of a sudden it was a serious question, which quickly turned into reality. We were actually looking to move to London - together. I told my mum a week after that. It took me three hours of ‘you can do this’ to muster up the courage and speak to her. Not because i wanted to or was excited by the idea of leaving, there was just no alternative. She said ‘absolutely no’.

</p>
<br>
<p>My parents divorced when I was 11. My father was jailed for money laundering in Greece when i was 15. He was released a year later but picked up a drinking and gambling problem.
Meanwhile, my mum was trying to keep together her business. She was a seamstress with her own wedding shop, in a town packed with wedding shops. One credit after the other and by the time of my 17th birthday, we had to sell our apartment and move in with my grandma. That helped for a few months but then the ‘overdue’ letters came. Soon after knocks on our door followed.
</p>
<br>
<p>
My mum started taking a payday loan after the other, just so she could cover the coasts of her credits. There was no light at the tunnel at this point. Only winning the lottery would have helped. I knew there was only one option, she did as well.
</p>
<br>
<p>What were our lives going to be in a god forsaken town of 70,000 people in a horribly corrupt country? And the fact that there was no other option for us but to end of on the streets.
So what do we do? Do we stay in that tiny two-bedroom apartment with my grandma, which we would eventually lose anyway? Or do we try somewhere else?

<p>I don’t want to know what it’s like to feel you are failing as a parent, I’m sure that’s how my mum felt - it took her lots of tears to tell me that. We decided we are going to move as soon as I was finished with high school. “Decided”. The phrase ‘between the devil and the deep blue sea’ resonates with how I felt.
</p>
<br><p>I had no other choice but to find a job and i did with the help of a friend who was studying in London. I even found a house for us. Well, a room in a house. A week before our flight, my mum got an offer to move to the Netherlands to work there. Someone she used to know said there was a job for her as a seamstress. She was so used to sewing she accepted immediately. A 42-year-old woman, with two Master degrees, having to start over in another county, away from everything she knew, away from her family. She was completely alone, at least I wasn’t.
</p><br>
<p>It took her three hours of being in the Netherlands to realise it was all a scam - there was no actual job. Luckily, my godfather, who lived in Belgium heard what happened and found her a job within a week - a job as a house cleaner. He bought her a plane ticket and as quickly as she got there - she left.
</p> <br>
<p>All this happened while I was still packing my suitcase. Most of my friends were soon starting university, either in Bulgaria or around Europe. They were moving away and starting their independent lives. I guess, it was time for me to grow up as well. I just didn’t have the choice.
</p>
<br>
<p>With mum out of the picture, it was just me and my ex-boyfriend. We packed our things, we said our goodbyes and we were on our way to what we hoped would be better lives. I was so scared but I didn’t tell anyone, what was the point? I told all my friends I wanted to go. That it was like a dream come true - it wasn’t.
</p>
<br>
<p>As soon as i got on that flight, all I could do was cry. Three hours and nine minutes of pure anxiety we landed at London Luton. ‘Here we go’ I thought. It’s time to put on a smile and work. The first 48 hours of being in London felt as if I was in a film. It was beautiful and disgusting at the same time. The immigrant mega city, powered by migrant money and migrant workers. I was exhausted and excited just by looking at people moving around me. </p>
<br><br>

<p>We ended up living in a house with 10 other people. We had one shelf in a fridge and shared a toilet with five people. It was loud and dirty all the time but that’s all we could afford then.
Within a week I got my insurance number and a bank account - that was my proudest moment. It felt like a green light, as if it was going to be okay.
</p>
<br>
<p>
And it was, I started cleaning houses soon after that. I usually would work between nine and 12 hours a day. It was a dirty job - literally. But I was making what felt like good money. At least compared to the Bulgarian standard, it was good. If there was one good thing about the complete lack of social life - it was saving some money.
</p><br>
<p>
I would wake up at 6am, spend at least two hours traveling from my house to where i would clean, work all day and then go ‘home’. My mum had a similar regime as mine. Even though she was so far away from me and I couldn’t see her, we were going through the same. During my worst days, I was still glad we moved.
</p>
<br>
<p>My ex-boyfriend started working on a construction site a few weeks after we arrived. I might have not liked cleaning strangers’ houses but he absolutely hated what he did. He was constantly complaining.</p>
<br>
<p>It turned into my little vicious cycle. I was absolutely exhausted all the time and I was stuck in one bedroom with someone who didn’t want to be there. We were together for two years prior to our move. I was so in love and he was so good at convincing me of what he wanted.
Four months in London and he changed his mind - he demanded we go back to Bulgaria. He was lazy and actual work was getting to him
</p>
<br><p>This time i had a choice, I could continue working as I was and stay on my own or follow him.
What felt like the first time, I actually had some control of where my life can go. We broke up two weeks later and he left, while I continued my adventure in London.
</p> <br><p>
For the last three years, I’ve felt endless gratitude towards a country, which didn’t owe me anything but gave me all I wanted anyway. I left a dreadful life behind for an opportunity which not everyone gets. I do realise I’m one of the many people who do the same thing and it’s starting to be a problem, well it has been for a few years now.

<br>
<p>What’s my right coming to the UK? The truth is I have none. I can only try and explain where i came from and that it was the only way out I saw. Does that matter to anyone though? I am another mouth to feed, another body for the NHS to take care of. As of now, I can’t argue if a British person would want to kick me out of their country, how could I? My only hope is to start helping society as much as it has helped me. The fact here is that I'm just one person out of the 1.4 million Eastern Europeans to come here since 2004 but I'm trying to overcome that.</p>
<br>
<p>Now I’m studying Tourism Management part-time and work as a waitress to pay my maintenance. It’s still hard and my family still lives in three different countries, which breaks my heart, hearing the word ‘credit’ still makes my skin crawl but it’s worth it. And I still get emotional when I hear Bulgarian folk music but now I know there’s a place in the world where hard work pays off. I have no other choice but to be here. </p>

<p>Best ‘Chow Mein’ I’ve ever had? It was at a restaurant called ‘Yum Yum’ in Sheffield. It had just the right taste and the scent was heavenly. That’s coming from someone who’s from Hong Kong, so i know quite a bit about Chinese food. At first, 28 years ago, it was quite odd to me, having a piece of home, somewhere absolutely different from my country but then i discovered a whole community here. </p>
<br>
<p>
It was 1990 when I came to the UK. I got an offer from a construction company here and at the age of 27 getting an opportunity like that is all you want. I was less excited about telling my wife. Convincing her to move to a whole different continent with our three-year-old son was a challenge on its own but she supported me, she always has. Telling our parents wasn’t a big issue, even though to this day I suspect mine didn’t approve. We were young and our lives were in front of us. At that lifestage if you get a promotion or a lucrative job offer, you take it - doesn’t matter where it is.
</p><br><div class="flex_container">
    <div class="item"><img src="images\nhs.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
</div>
<p>We sorted visas and we were on our way. I was so excited to start working at Henry Boot Construction that I didn’t really pay attention to much else. We just did it. And with my wife’s medical degree, we weren’t really nervous. At that time England was a very fast developing country, hungry for experts and migrant workers -  it still is. Only difference now is with the aging population, migrants are mostly needed in the NHS. Nurses, just like my wife, are the engine of the health system, even at the time she immediately found a job.
</p><br>

<p>Back then I didn’t think about how different it would be or that I would miss home. Luckily, we had friends who were already living in Sheffield and they helped us settle. I started working and soon enough we adjusted to life here. We did miss home at first but you can’t have everything and after the first year we created a home of our own.</p>
<br>
<p>I keep in touch with my mum as much as i can, and I try to make sure she’s okay but there’s not so much I can do 6,000 miles away. She refuses to come to England and I do understand. She’s lived her whole life in one place and she never learned English, why would she want to come? I’m an only child and i do worry about her. She’s 73-years-old and there’s a nurse taking care of her but it’s not the same. Our relationship has changed a lot.The only way we communicate now is via texts and calls, with the nurse operating on the other side.
 </p>
<br>
<p>My dad died five years ago, it was so sudden i didn’t have time to fly back. It was a heart attack. I was only there in time for the funeral. In the 28 years of living in the UK this has been my only regret and probably the only thing my mum will not forgive me for. I just can’t imagine living anywhere different from the north of England.
</p><br> <p>People here are so welcoming, so I wanted to contribute back to society. That’s how i got involved in the Chinese school. I also wanted my son to learn more about Chinese culture and the language as well. He was four when we came to the UK.  While he studied in regular school during the week, every Sunday I would drive him to the Chinese school so he could learn about where he came from.</p>
<br><p>It’s such an important part for one’s identity, knowing your roots and accepting them. Bringing your own customs and enriching culture is something i would always cherish. However, there’s an important balance to be kept. Without integrating into society and keeping to your ‘own’, you are essentially creating a ghetto. It’s a choice you make and an easy trap to fall in. It’s something I’ve been very cautious about. Some of my friends had to go back because they couldn’t deal with the cultural difference. </p>

<br><p>That balance of accepting and living with British culture and at the same time combining it with yours. Some people just don’t do that. They stick to what they know, don’t tolerate anything else and end up living amongst immigrants from the same country. I understand how that is a problem and a valid argument against multiculturalism but at the same time, it’s extremely hard to put a whole nationality under the same common denominator.
</p>
<br><p>I’m proud of where I come from and my way of that balance was to get involved with the Chinese school. I ended up volunteering as head teacher. Every Sunday, while i still go to work during the week, I come to help educate children. We promote our culture and it’s not just about the food, it’s about showing our traditions as well.
</p>
<br><p>
It’s bizarre to think that now I’ve lived in England as long as i have in Hong Kong, makes you wonder about where you are actually from. If someone asked me where I call home, I think now i would answer England. My family is here, my friends are here, my community is here.
</p> <br>
<p>It’s even more odd sometimes because my children have been brought up here. My daughter was born in the UK and my son was educated by the english standards.
Even though we’ve brought them up with our values, you can tell there are differences between us. That’s inevitable I think. It's something that troubles me. For their whole lives, they will be considered foreign just because they don't look typically British even though they are.
</p><br><p>Back in the day we used to visit Hong Kong every other year for a couple of weeks, but that’s not their home. It’s the place where their grandparents live. When they were little they loved visiting, now that’s not the case anymore. I do understand it’s foreign to them and they don’t have any friends there, so it can get pretty boring pretty fast. However, it’s still a hard thing to explain to their grandparents.
</p> <br>
<p>It’s even harder to imagine what our lives would have been if we stayed in Hong Kong. I'm not sure I want to.</p><br>

  <p>There are three nationalities in my family, my parents are Ghanaian, I was born in Germany and my little sister was born in the UK, where I’ve lived most of my life. So when someone asks me: “Where are you from?” there isn’t a simple answer I can give, which captures my identity. So I either explain my family history, or just tell them I’m Ghanaian because I’m black and that makes sense to people.  </p> <br>
<p>Saying I’m German might be the most accurate, after all, that’s what my passport says but I’ve lived in Stuttgart for only eight years with my parents and two brothers. My accent has no traces of German, I barely even know the language. And we did leave Germany because I am black.</p><br>
<p>Saying I’m British feels as foreign to me as the other two nationalities. Here people always remind you this is not where you’re really from, this is where you came. It just doesn’t feel right to my soul but after a while I realised what I am. </p><br><p>I’m a Ghanaian Londoner. </p>

<p>I was reading statistics recently and there was an interesting number that caught my eye. Around 40% of London’s population was born abroad, that’s almost half. Thousands and even millions of people - just like me. I’ve been living in London for the past 16 years and it feels like my home. ‘Home’ - what a funny word. What is home, where is it? So many people identify themselves with where they come from, with their communities and their national pride. One word which can most certainly not describe me is ‘nationalistic’.</p>
<br><p>You can hear more than 300 languages in the streets of London, it’s the most diverse city in the world. From Albania to Zimbabwe - people are making a life for themselves here, just like we did. The whole world in one city, how amazing is that? It doesn’t feel like the rest of Britain. And with that many different people and cultures, London might not even be British anymore. It has everything you would ever need or want. That’s why I love it so much. I am just another thread in the multi-coloured tapestry of culture and traditions. </p>
<br>
<p>Even with all those different people, there’s still racism. However, it’s less than anywhere else in Britain as well as in Europe. That's why we had to move from the green, clean suburbs of Stuttgart to the crowded outskirts of east London. Barely a year into primary school and my parents realised one of my teachers had a ‘special’ attitude towards me - the only black kid in class. </p>
<br>
<p>I knew I was different but I didn’t realise it was a reason for someone not to like me, especially at the delicate age of eight. It only sunk in years later when we were already in London. It broke my heart that my parents had to pack all of our stuff yet again, this time with three children under their wings and try somewhere else. They didn’t explain to us why we were moving, how could they? One day I was playing at my friend’s house, the next I was in a plane crying at the top of my lungs because my life was being ripped away from me.

<br>
<p>First few years living in the UK were horrible. I had a funny accent and watching BBC news was how I was learning English. I had no friends and I spent more time crying in the playground than anything else. While other kids were learning as normal I was trying to understand what the teacher was saying from the back of the classroom.</p>
<br>
<p>At least I bonded with my bigger brother, Michael. He was going through exactly the same. We spent years adjusting our lives, there was so much anger and sadness during those first year. I missed my home, my friends and everything we left behind, I missed my freedom. While we lived in Germany I could go to school and visit my friends on my own. Once we moved, I wasn’t allowed to go anywhere by myself until I turned 14. My freedom was gone - my childhood followed suit. </p>
<br>
<p>My parents were in their 20s when they moved to Germany. I don’t know how they did it, they didn’t speak the language nor knew anyone. Their only motivation was the thought of the life they could have in Europe. They did it for themselves and for my siblings and I. I can’t imagine the pressure they were under to learn and adapt. I tried studying German again and now I can appreciate how hard it’s to learn a new language, even though I had some foundations. They didn’t even have that.</p>
<br>
<p>I’m very grateful for all their sacrifices so we could have the opportunities they didn’t have growing up. I’m also very glad I wasn’t brought up in Ghana because living in Europe has made me the person I am today. I don’t know if I would have been a feminist or I would be able to understand the struggles of immigrants otherwise. That’s something I learnt from my surroundings, not from my parents. </p>
<br>
<p>The difference between us is that all I know is life in western European. If I was to be married my parents would want a traditional Ghanaian wedding. But because I’ve been raised here I have a different mentality and I wouldn’t want that. When we go to visit my grandparents - even they don’t view me as Ghanaian. They see me as a foreigner, they recognise that I’m not from there just by the way I walk. I understand, I’ve never lived there. All my ideas about the country come from someone else and not my own experience. </p>
<br>
<p>I can’t identify myself with just one place, because I’m not from just one country. My life has been infused with many diverse people. Maybe it’s because I have more than one cultural imprints on my upbringing or maybe because nowadays being nationalistic seems outdated to me. But I’m 24, I am a child of no country but of the world. I don’t want to settle down and stay in one place. I want to explore. I have the privilege to feel like I can go anywhere and I could do anything. That’s a lesson London has taught me.

<p>They are only three out of the millions of immigrants in the UK. They all have different lives, attitudes and inspirations but what they have in common is their fight for a normal life.</p>
<p>People are brought up with different prejudice, and the only way to let go is by experiencing the issue first hand. By meeting people, hearing their stories and feeling that sympathy for what they’ve been through.</p>
<p>Divisive debates won't help the situation, which everyone agrees is problematic, understanding where each one of us comes from is the key to moving forward.</p>
<p>There's a big question mark about the future of immigration in the UK. While no one knows what will happen, let's try to understand both sides and be human to one another.</p>
